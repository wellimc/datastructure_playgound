/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/
 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
 * <p>
 * A leaf is a node with no children.
 * Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
